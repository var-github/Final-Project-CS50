# Final-Project
#### The project entails a library management system designed to be used by the people who are enrolled in a library. All new users of the library are prompted to register into the application by providing a username and password.
#### After registering/logging in users can search, borrow and return books. The process is independent of the librarian and hence is convienient and snappy.
*The application is not only ment for borrowing and returning books, but also for browsing through the books in the library.*

&nbsp;
### The app has three main parts:
- Searching books
- Borrowing books
- Returning books

### *Search Books*
Searching books is one of the main tasks the application handles and to do so the application uses an API.
